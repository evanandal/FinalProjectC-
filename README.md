Our initiative focuses on the Hospital Management System. It contains five pages, which are the home page, view information page, add doctor/patient page, and remove doctor/patient page. On the main page, there are four buttons that take the user to the other four pages. The view page features two buttons at the top: doctor and patient. When the doctor button is clicked, it displays a list of available doctors along with their ID, qualifications, room number, and timings. In the same way, the patient button includes a list of patients that shows their details. The third page contains a search function for locating the patient or doctor by name, allowing the user to swiftly find the desired individual. The fourth page presents 2 options once more. Including the physician or the patient. To include a patient, the management can simply input their ID, name, illness they have, gender, and age. Upon clicking the submit button, it will refresh the patients table in the database and the list on the view page. The identical approach is utilized for the doctors as well. However, it requires a password from the management side since altering doctorsâ€™ information shouldn't be done so effortlessly. Therefore, a password will be required initially to add a doctor. The remainder is identical to adding the patient. The final page is designated for deleting any doctor or patient from the database. It will once more request the password from the management team to remove any doctor from the list, ensuring that only they can alter the database. Nonetheless, they can effortlessly discharge the patients by entering their details.
